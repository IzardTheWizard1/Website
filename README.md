# Personal Resume Website

This repository contains a simple resume and biography site for Izrael Fisi. It uses the **Dimension** template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) and includes sections for biography, experience, education, skills, awards, and contact information.

The original `html5up-dimension.zip` file is kept for reference, but the website content lives inside the `site/` directory. Open `site/index.html` in a browser to view the page.

Additional open-source graphics from the [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/github/explore) repository are used for the skills and awards sections.
